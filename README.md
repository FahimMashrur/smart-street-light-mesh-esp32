# Smart Street Lighting System using ESP32 Mesh Network

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Smart Street Lighting System developed as part of a Bachelor’s thesis at Savonia University of Applied Sciences.

The system consists of four Arduino Nano ESP32 nodes connected in a mesh network. Each node includes a PIR motion sensor and an LED to simulate street lighting behavior.

## Objectives
- Implement motion-based street lighting
- Enable communication using mesh networking
- Reduce unnecessary energy consumption
- Demonstrate a scalable IoT system

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Nano ESP32 (4 nodes)
- PIR motion sensors
- LEDs with resistors
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Tools
- Arduino IDE
- painlessMesh library
- ESP32 Arduino core

## Repository Structure
- `code/` – Arduino source code for each node
- `circuit-diagram/` – Breadboard and schematic diagrams
- `architecture/` – System and mesh architecture diagrams
- `results/` – Test results and experiment photos
- `documentation/` – Setup and usage instructions
